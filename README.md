# KNN algorithm on Iris Dataset
## Overview
This project implements the **K-Nearest-Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to classify flower in the **Iris dataset**
The goal is to predict the species of an iris flower based on features such as sepal length , sepal width , petal length
, and petal width.

## Dataset
- The dataset used is the classic [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris) from UCI Machine Learning Repository
- It contains **150 samples** with **4 features** and **3 classes**:
  - Setosa (type 0)
  - Vesicolo (type 1)
  - Virginian (type 2)
- A copy of dataset split to 70% train and 30% test included
